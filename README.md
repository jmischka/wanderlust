WanderLust is a travel application and personal project created using the NY Times API and SkyScanner.  The app enables users to read up-to-date Travel news, offers random 'Spin-The-Bottle' Travel Inspiration, and book one-way and round-trip airline tickets.   

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
